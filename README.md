# Cancer simulation
We implemented cancer development and chemotherapy impact simulation using **stochastic cellular automaton** with Python

# Instalation
To use app you must clone it from git repo and install requirements. Preferrable version Python3.12
```
git clone https://github.com/Zhukowych/CancerSimulation.git
cd CancerSimulation
pip install -r requirements
```

# Model
In this project we implemented models proposed in the following articles: 
- [Cellular-automaton model for tumor growth dynamics: Virtualization of different scenarios](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522011891?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8800d112bd3635b1)
- [A cellular automata model of chemotherapy effects on tumour growth: targeting cancer and immune cells](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13873954.2019.1571515)

As a result we have have following states:
